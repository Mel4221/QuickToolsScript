# About
 QuickToolsScript is basically the shell version from the library QuickTools which provides a set of features  such as 
 compressing , encryping , io navigation , scripting languaghe inbeded in it plus must of the funtionalities given in other shells
 
# How Does it work 

As this is the Shell from a library all the shell does it either call the methods in quickTools or give the posibillty to  write your own code and give it to it for it to read it and execute the commands in given text 

It has a direct access to the shell by giving as an argument the word "shell" as an argument
from the terminal but you could just hit shell in the menu as well

As you may see is very similar to the version from some terminas out there at least in looks
 at the time it support a very limited amount of commands such as 
 1. cd
 2. cp
 3. mv
 4. ls
 5. ls-l
 6. ls *file extention
 7. rm or remove *don't required anythinng else it could literally remove a folder or a file  buf for the lovers of rm -r i added just in case 
 8. rm -r
 9. cat
 10. clear 
 11. touch
 12. echo *works but is not fullly supported yet  nor the magic of it
 13. du *thought it only prints the size of the file and it does it in auto as -h  Human
 14. mkdir
 
 > Must of this methods have another alias just to help a bit such as 
 1. rm as delete 
 2. touch as create
 3. ls as list-files or list
