Today 5/13/2023
I was thinking that it will be a great idea to add a todo list to give a fallow up to what i'm thinking to work on 
because i have a very bad habbyt of not documenting some of my code nor what i'm planning to work on  so tody will 
be the first day that i will try to write what i want to do before i start coding 

Issue 1: 
	*selec multiple files by the critieria given , is such a normal feature in terminals and this shell must have it 
	with given commands such as 
									ls *.pdf
									cat *.txt
									size *.iso


Issue 2:
	c: refer to upper path or disk drive by getting the letter of it or just typing the required slash such as /inLinux 
	or on window \ 
	Solved Partialy


	I decided to go by the seasiets one today which is the Issue 1 
	since it will just required  to add some switch case that takes in consideration that if  "*"
	is given multiple files if exsit has to be selected
	lastly in some commands as the ls is even easier to just to add a condition to only print the ones that meet the craiteriea.

			BONUS POINTS : I GOT INTO ADDING THHE -r paramter to rm || delete function 


Issue 3: 
	the select command has a funtionality of holding the reference of an object such as 
	path for a file o the path for a folder but on the way that is implemented it does not work 
	since is adding the Target with the reference of the path of the file and there has to be a better
	way to fix that
